Bespoke-themes is a set of custom, medium contrast, light and dark themes for Emacs
(intended for GUI, though basic support in terminal has been added). There is also a
related, and optional, [[https://github.com/mclear-tools/bespoke-modeline][custom modeline]]. This started as a fork of [[https://github.com/rougier][Nicolas Rougier's]]
work on [[https://github.com/rougier/elegant-emacs][elegant-emacs]] and [[https://github.com/rougier/nano-emacs][nano-emacs]], but has evolved with some ideas and colors
borrowed from [[https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#color-theme-creation][material colors]], [[https://github.com/bbatsov/solarized-emacs][solarized]] and [[https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-emacs][nord]], as well as color design aided by
[[https://coolors.co][coolers.co]] and the classic [[https://www.c82.net/werner/][Werner's Nomenclature]].

The theme is notably less conservative/minimal than nano- or elegant-emacs, in
the sense that it has a broader color palette and sets fewer configuration conditions
on fonts and ui elements, but bespoke-themes otherwise shares many of its basic
themeing ideas with the good work done by Rougier (see also his work on [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06030][on the design
of text editors]]).

The theme sets six core colors, plus five highlight/accent colors, and colors for
foreground, background, modeline, and highlight. The light and dark variants aim to
be as consistent as possible in their use of colors, and to set a decent compromise
between aesthetics and readability:

#+BEGIN_HTML
<div>
<img src="./screenshots/display-colors.png"/>
</div>
#+END_HTML

Faces are fairly comprehensive, including (optional) evil cursor colors. I'm trying
to add faces on a regular basis. If there is a face you'd like to see added please
open an issue.

*NOTE*: It is still early days for this theme, so there may be significant and/or
breaking changes made from one commit to the next. I also may continue to tweak
colors slightly to find the best balance between aesthetics and readability.
Suggestions and pull requests are welcome!

**** Breaking Changes:

I'll try and log all breaking changes, including renaming functions and variables here:

- 10/19: Moved modeline to its [[https://github.com/mclear-tools/bespoke-modeline][own repo]]
- 6/13: Normalized all modeline variable names from =bespoke...modeline= to =bespoke...mode-line= for consistency (commit: e119c0a)
- 6/12: Renamed =bespoke-set-mode-line-height= to =bespoke-set-mode-line-size= (commit: a46b7b5)

  
*** Options

- You can set italics for keywords or comments (or both).
- You can set variable-pitch for headlines using =(bespoke-set-variable-pitch)=.
- There is a toggle function for toggling between light and dark theme variants:
  =(bespoke/toggle-theme)=. You can also call each theme variant directly with
  =(bespoke/light-theme)= or =(bespoke/dark-theme)=.
- All options are available via =customize-group=, and can also be found in the
  =bespoke-themes.el= file.


*** Settings
Here's one possible way of setting up the theme. Note that since this theme is
currently not on Melpa the [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] setup below utilizes [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight]] to install
packages, but you can of course install it from this repo however you wish.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package bespoke-themes
  :straight (:host github :repo "mclear-tools/bespoke-themes" :branch "main")
  :config
  ;; Set evil cursor colors
  (setq bespoke-set-evil-cursors t)
  ;; Set use of italics
  (setq bespoke-set-italic-comments t
        bespoke-set-italic-keywords t)
  ;; Set variable pitch
  (setq bespoke-set-variable-pitch t)
  ;; Set initial theme variant
  (setq bespoke-set-theme 'dark)
  ;; Load theme
  (load-theme 'bespoke t))
#+end_src

To get windows to divide in a more attractive manner use the following setting:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Vertical window divider
(use-package frame
  :straight (:type built-in)
  :custom
  (window-divider-default-right-width 12)
  (window-divider-default-bottom-width 1)
  (window-divider-default-places 'right-only)
  (window-divider-mode t))
;; Make sure new frames use window-divider
(add-hook 'before-make-frame-hook 'window-divider-mode)

#+end_src

For the padding in frame used in the screenshots try the following settings:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Make a clean & minimalist frame
(use-package frame
  :straight (:type built-in)
  :config
  (setq-default default-frame-alist
                (append (list
                '(font . "SF Mono:style=medium:size=15") ;; NOTE: substitute whatever font you prefer here
                '(internal-border-width . 20)
                '(left-fringe    . 0)
                '(right-fringe   . 0)
                '(tool-bar-lines . 0)
                '(menu-bar-lines . 0)
                '(vertical-scroll-bars . nil))))
  (setq-default window-resize-pixelwise t)
  (setq-default frame-resize-pixelwise t)
#+end_src

To get a splash screen see Rougier's [[https://github.com/rougier/emacs-splash][splash.el]]. You can see my customization of it [[https://github.com/mclear-tools/dotemacs/blob/master/setup-config/setup-splash.el][here]].

For dimming non-active windows try [[https://github.com/gonewest818/dimmer.el][dimmer.el]]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Dim inactive windows
(use-package dimmer
  :straight (:host github :repo "gonewest818/dimmer.el")
  :hook (after-init . dimmer-mode)
  :config
  (setq dimmer-fraction 0.5)
  (setq dimmer-adjustment-mode :foreground)
  (setq dimmer-use-colorspace :rgb)
  (setq dimmer-watch-frame-focus-events nil)
  (dimmer-configure-which-key)
  (dimmer-configure-magit)
  (dimmer-configure-posframe))
#+end_src
